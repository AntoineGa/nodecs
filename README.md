# NodeCs

NodeCs is a 'hot reload' Dockerfile to simplify [DNX][] app development. The Dockerfile is based on the
[Microsoft ASP.Net Docker Image][] and adds to it an installation of [Node.js][] along with [nodemon][] and a
nuget.config that uses the beta builds from the [MyGet feed][].

Using this Dockerfile it will restore your app's packages and then watch file changes for `*.cs` and
`*.json` extensions. Simply open your [DNX][] app in your favorite [OmniSharp][] editor, make changes
and watch them get executed in Docker.

## Usage
To get started using this Dockerfile simply follow the steps below:



1. Clone this repo

- Move to the relevant version directory

- Run `docker build -t jchannon/nodecs:1.0.0-beta7 .`

- Move to the samples directory

- __NOTE :__ On OSX/Windows you must create a folder share between your Docker VM and your OS

- Run `docker run -it -p 5001:5001 -v /mnt/hgfs/Projects/MyApp:/src -w /src jchannon/nodecs:1.0.0-beta7`

Now you can browse to `http://DOCKER_IP:5001` to see your app.

To see 'hot reload' in action:

- Make a change to a file in your app in your editor
- Go to your browser, press F5 and bingo!
